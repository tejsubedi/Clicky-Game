# Clicky-Game

## Overview
- The game is a web game application where users can click images of birds in order to earn points. 
- The user can be the winner of the game whenever he or she has clicked all 12 of the birds  correctly.
- The application should keep track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.
- Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.
- Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.
